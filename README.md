# Algorithms-for-Battery-Management-Systems

# Specialization - 5 course series
In this specialization, you will learn the major functions that must be performed by a battery management system, how lithium-ion battery cells work and how to model their behaviors mathematically, and how to write algorithms (computer methods) to estimate state-of-charge, state-of-health, remaining energy, and available power, and how to balance cells in a battery pack. 

# Applied Learning Project

Learners will start with supplied code templates (in the Octave/MATLAB language) to build their own code to simulate lithium-ion battery cells and packs, and to estimate battery cell state-of-charge, state-of-health (capacity and resistance), remaining energy, and available power.
